# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (2020)

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

## Introduction

All the assignments and quizzes of the 5 Courses are archived in the repo. <font color="blue">**Note that the resources can only be used for learning instead of any commercial purpose.**</font> Also, I hope that you don't copy any part of the code, because the assignment can be easily finished as long as you watch the video carefully. Remember that understanding the content is the most important thing.

All the assignments were downloaded by the [official recommended method](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/360004990332-Download-Jupyter-Workspace-files).

The five courses titles are:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.
5. Sequence Models.

what you will learn in this course:

- Basic Neural Network, CNN, RNN
- (Python based) Deep Learning architecture: Tensorflow, Keras 
- Markdown

## About This Specialization
- (From me)
> It's very lucky for me to learn this deep learning course as a start. I can learn the key points in details from the vivid description from Andrew Ng. Also, the quiz and assignment are relatively easy based on a good understanding of the class content. Furthermore, the part of practice is designed to solve meaningful problems in daily life, which really inspires me to dive into the deep learning area.

> If you want to break into AI, this Specialization will help you do so. Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in tech. We will help you become good at Deep Learning.
>
> In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.
>
> You will also hear from many top leaders in Deep Learning, who will share with you their personal stories and give you career advice.
>
> AI is transforming multiple industries. After finishing this specialization, you will likely find creative ways to apply it to your work.
>
> We will help you master Deep Learning, understand how to apply it, and build a career in AI.
